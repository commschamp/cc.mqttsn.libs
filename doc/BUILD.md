# How to Build

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) cross-platform build system to
generate required build files native to the platform. Please refer to the 
main [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt) file for the info on available options and 
other variables.

## External Dependencies
The provided libraries depend on several external projects:
- [cc.mqttsn.generated](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqttsn.generated) -
  provides definition of the MQTT-SN protocol.
- [cc.mqtt311.generated](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt311.generated) - 
  provides definition of the MQTT v3.1.1 protocol.
- [comms_champion](https://github.com/commschamp/comms_champion) - 
  provides [COMMS library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms_champion#comms-library)
  which is used to define the protocols.

In case these external dependencies are also built externally paths to them
can be provided using **CC_MQTTSN_GENERATED_INSTALL_DIR**, **CC_MQTT311_GENERATED_INSTALL_DIR**,
and **CC_MAIN_INSTALL_DIR** respectively. If these paths are not provided, the
build process will check out and build the necessary dependencies.


## Choosing C++ Standard

Since CMake v3.1 it became possible to set version of C++ standard by setting
**CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD** variable. If no value of this variable is set in command
line arguments, default value **11** will be assigned to it. In order to use
c++14 standard in compilation, set the variable value to **14**. 

Please **NOTE**, that _clang_ compiler has problems compiling valid c++11 constructs
used in this project. Hence, the compilation will fail unless the compilation is
configured to use c++14 standard.

## Build and Install Examples

The examples below are Linux/Unix system oriented, i.e. they use **make** utility
to build the "install" target after configuration with **cmake**. 

On Windows
systems with Visual Studio compiler, the CMake utility generates Visual Studio
solution files by default. Build "install" project. It is also possible to 
generate Makefile-s on Windows by providing additional **-G "NMake Makefiles"** option
to **cmake**. In this case use **nmake** utility instead of **make**.

Please review the examples below and use appropriate option that suites your
needs. Remember to add **-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release** option for release
builds.

### Build MQTT-SN Client/Gateway Libraries and Applications
```
$> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

### Build Two Custom Client Libraries
See [custom_client_build.md](custom_client_build.md)
for details on custom build configuration
```
$> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCC_MQTTSN_CLIENT_DEFAULT_LIB=OFF \
    -DCC_MQTTSN_BUILD_GATEWAY=OFF \
    -DCC_MQTTSN_CUSTOM_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILES=config1.cmake\;config2.cmake ..
```

### Build Gateway Library and Application(s)
```
$> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCC_MQTTSN_CLIENT_DEFAULT_LIB=OFF ..
```
