/// @mainpage MQTT-SN Client Library
/// @tableofcontents
/// @section mqttsn_client_overview Overview
/// The <b>MQTT-SN Client Library</b> provides simple, asynchronous, non-blocking,
/// and easy to use interface to operate MQTT-SN client. The library doesn't
/// make any assumption on the system it is running on, as well as on the type
/// of I/O link being used to communicate its data to the MQTT-SN gateway.
///
/// The main logic of operation can be described as following:
///
/// @li Sends and receives over the I/O link are managed outside this
///     library. The data received from the gateway is provided to the library for processing
///     (see mqttsn_client_process_data()) and the data to be sent to the gateway is
///     provided by the library using callback (see 
///     mqttsn_client_set_send_output_data_callback()).
/// @li The library requires measurement of timeouts, it will request to
///     do so using callback (see  
///     mqttsn_client_set_next_tick_program_callback()).
///     The driving code will have to use available system timer
///     and notify the library about the requested time expiry (see mqttsn_client_tick()).
/// @li Sometimes the library will terminate the previously requested time
///     measurement request and inquire the amount of elapsed milliseconds 
///     since last request. Such inquiry is performed using callback (see 
///     mqttsn_client_set_cancel_next_tick_wait_callback()).
/// @li The library supports only @b one asynchronous operation at a time. The
///     next one can @b NOT be started until previous one complete or cancelled.
/// @li All the asynchronous operations receive pointer to callback function, 
///     which will be invoked when the operation is complete.
/// @li When asynchronous operation request receives pointer to any buffer 
///     (string or raw data), this buffer must be preserved intact by the caller
///     until the asynchronous operation is complete (provided callback is called).
///
/// @section mqttsn_client_io_links Various I/O Links
/// MQTT-SN is designed to be a @b datagram protocol, i.e. if sent message is 
/// received by the other side, it is received <b>in full</b> and 
/// <b>without errors</b>. If sent over UDP link, it can be used as is. The
/// UDP transport cares about all the rest. However, when sent over other 
/// I/O link, such as RS-232 serial connection, the protocol may require additional
/// transport wrapping to insure correct delivery and differentiate between packets.
///
/// The interface, this <b>MQTT-SN Client Library</b> provides, allows any
/// sent or received data to be wrapped with or unwrapped from additional 
/// independent transport data, that insures safe and correct delivery.
///
/// @section mqttsn_client_header Header
/// To use this <b>MQTT-SN Client Library</b> use the following include statement:
/// @code
/// #include "mqttsn/client.h"
/// @endcode
///
/// @section mqttsn_client_allocation Client Allocation
/// The library supports may support multiple independent MQTT-SN clients. The
/// allocation of data structures relevant to a single client is performed 
/// using mqttsn_client_new() function.
/// @code
/// MqttsnClientHandle client = mqttsn_client_new();
/// @endcode
/// All other functions are client specific, the receive the returned handle 
/// as their first parameter.
///
/// When work with allocated client is complete, it must be freed using
/// mqttsn_client_free() function.
/// @code
/// mqttsn_client_free(client);
/// @endcode
/// 
/// All the allocated clients are completely independent. It is safe to use
/// multiple threads working with multiple clients as long as there are no
/// concurrent accesses to the same one.
///
/// @section mqttsn_client_setup Client Setup
/// As was mentioned earlier, there is a need for multiple callbacks to be
/// set. Four of them are mandatory.
/// -# Callback to be invoked when new message needs to be sent to the gateway
/// (see mqttsn_client_set_send_output_data_callback()).
/// @code
/// void my_send(void* userData, const unsigned char* buf, unsigned bufLen, bool broadcast)
/// {
///     if (broadcast) {
///         ... /* broadcast */
///     }
///     else {
///         ... /* send data to connected GW*/
///     }
/// }
///
/// void* someUserData = ...;
/// mqttsn_client_set_send_output_data_callback(client, &my_send, someUserData);
/// @endcode
/// -# Callback to be invoked when timer needs to be programmed
/// (see mqttsn_client_set_next_tick_program_callback()).
/// @code
/// void my_timer(void* userData, unsigned ms)
/// {
///     ... /* Program asynchronous timer to tick after requested number of milliseconds. When expires invoke mqttsn_client_tick() */
/// }
///
/// mqttsn_client_set_next_tick_program_callback(client, &my_timer, someUserData);
/// @endcode
/// -# Callback to be invoked when previous timer program needs to be cancelled
/// and number of elapsed seconds since last timer programming request known
/// (see mqttsn_client_set_cancel_next_tick_wait_callback()).
/// @code
/// unsigned my_cancel_timer(void* userData)
/// {
///     ... /* cancel timer */
///     return ...; /* return number of elapsed milliseconds */
/// }
///
/// mqttsn_client_set_cancel_next_tick_wait_callback(client, &my_cancel_timer, someUserData);
/// @endcode
/// -# Callback to be invoked when new application message arrives
/// (see mqttsn_client_set_message_report_callback()).
/// @code
/// void my_message_handler(void* userData, const MqttsnMessageInfo* msgInfo)
/// {
///     ... /* handle application message */
/// }
///
/// mqttsn_client_set_message_report_callback(client, &my_message_handler, someUserData);
/// @endcode
///
/// All other callbacks are optional and described in later sections.
///
/// MQTT-SN protocol defines some messages that need to be acknowledged by the
/// gateway. If the expected response is not received after some time, the 
/// message needs to be resent. After number of such retry attempts if there is
/// still no response, the requested operation needs to terminate with relevant
/// error code. The retry period in seconds can be configured using 
/// mqttsn_client_set_retry_period() function and number of retry attempts
/// can be configured using mqttsn_client_set_retry_count() function. The 
/// default values are @b 15 seconds and @b 3 attempts respectively.
/// @code
/// mqttsn_client_set_retry_period(client, 5); // retry after 5 seconds
/// mqttsn_client_set_retry_count(client, 4); // perform 4 retry attempts
/// @endcode
///
/// After client has been successfully configured, it needs to be started.
/// @code
/// MqttsnErrorCode result = mqttsn_client_start(client);
/// if (result != MqttsnErrorCode_Success) {
///     ... /* start has failed, probably some mandatory callback hasn't been set */
/// }
/// @endcode
/// If a gateway needs to be discovered (see @ref mqttsn_client_gateways), the
/// client will immediately request to send generated @b SEARCHGW message.
///
/// If client's work needs to be paused for a while, it can be stopped using
/// mqttsn_client_stop() and restarted again using mqttsn_client_start().
///
/// @section mqttsn_client_data_recv Receiving Data
/// When new data datagram is successfully received over I/O link, it needs
/// to be passed to the library for processing using mqttsn_client_process_data().
/// @code
/// unsigned char buf[1024] = {0};
/// ... /* Read data into buffer */
///
/// unsigned consumed = mqttsn_client_process_data(client, &buf[0], bytesCount);
/// if (consumed < bytesCount) {
///     ... /* Unexpected protocol error, too few bytes consumed. */
/// }
/// @endcode
/// The mqttsn_client_process_data() function returns number of bytes that
/// were actually processed. If number of processed bytes is less that number
/// of bytes residing in the buffer, then probably some unexpected protocol error has
/// occurred.
///
/// The invocation of mqttsn_client_process_data() function may cause invocation
/// of multiple callbacks, such as cancellation of the current time measurement,
/// report of incoming new application message, report information about new 
/// gateway, asynchronous operation completion, request to send data back to
/// the gateway, and reprogram timer with new delay value.
///
/// @section mqttsn_client_data_send Sending Data
/// As was mentioned earlier, the request to send data is performed using callback
/// function. It is set using mqttsn_client_set_send_output_data_callback().
/// @code
/// void my_send(void* userData, const unsigned char* buf, unsigned bufLen, bool broadcast)
/// {
///     ...
/// }
///
/// mqttsn_client_set_send_output_data_callback(client, &my_send, someUserData);
/// @endcode
/// @b NOTE, that the callback function receives pointer to the buffer of data.
/// This buffer will be destroyed or updated right after the function returns.
/// The callback code may require to copy the buffer contents to some other
/// private data structure and preserve it until data has been properly sent
/// over the I/O link in full.
///
/// Also @b NOTE the @b broadcast boolean parameter. It specifies whether the
/// data needs to be broadcasted on the network or sent directly to the 
/// gateway that the client is connected to.
///
/// @section mqttsn_client_gateways Gateway Discovery
/// The MQTT-SN protocol built to be suitable for wireless sensor networks, where
/// the exact address of the gateway may be unknown upfront or there may be
/// multiple gateways available. As the result it includes messages for 
/// gateway tracking and discovery. However, when the address of the gateway to use is known,
/// the gateway discovery may become unnecessary. The <b>MQTT-SN Client Library</b>
/// provides an ability to enable or disable broadcast of @b SEARCHGW message,
/// which causes available gateways to respond and be identified.
/// @code
/// mqttsn_client_set_searchgw_enabled(client, false); /* Disable sending of SEARCHGW messages to discover the gateway */
/// @endcode
/// By default, the broadcast of @b SEARCHGW message is 
/// @b enabled, and the library will immediately request to do so when 
/// call to mqttsn_client_start() is performed.
///
/// The library monitors the @b GWINFO responses of the gateways as well as 
/// their own independent advertising of their presence (using @b ADVERTISE
/// message) and reports the discovered gateways via callback.
/// @code
/// void my_gw_status_report(void* userData, unsigned char gwId, MqttsnGwStatus status)
/// {
///     if (status == MqttsnGwStatus_Available) {
///         ... /* New gateway has been discovered */
///     }
///     else if (status == MqttsnGwStatus_TimedOut) {
///         ... /* The gateway hasn't advertise its presence for a while, probably is not available any more */
///     }
///     ...
/// }
/// mqttsn_client_set_gw_status_report_callback(client, &my_gw_status_report, someUserData);
/// @endcode
/// The gateways report their numeric ID (only one byte long), 
/// which is expected be unique on the available network.
/// This ID is passed as a parameter to the provided callback. However, 
/// in order to connect to the chosen available gateway, there may be a need to know
/// address of the latter. In this case, the driving code should store the origin address
/// of every message in its private data structures prior to forwarding the
/// incoming data to the library for processing (see @ref mqttsn_client_data_recv).
/// If the gateway status report callback is called immediately, indicating
/// available gateway, the reported ID as well as recorded address may be
/// stored as gateway identification information and to be used for connection
/// in the future.
///
/// @b NOTE, that the library sends @b SEARCHGW messages only when there is no
/// known available gateway. It will continue to send them periodically
/// until first available gateway responds. After that, the library will count
/// on any new gateways to independently advertise their presence using 
/// @b ADVERTISE message, when they become available. When the last known
/// gateway fails to re-advertise its presence after some time, the library will
/// resume sending @b SEARCHGW messages again until first gateway responds.
///
/// Also @b NOTE, that the reported list of available gateways is indicative 
/// only. There may be the case when some gateway gone offline, but the library
/// hasn't reported that it's missing yet. The opposite case may also take place,
/// when some gateway failed to advertise its presence in time, and hence was
/// reported as "timed out", but may still be online and respond to messages.
/// The only way to identify the real availability of the gateway is to try
/// to connect to it (see @ref mqttsn_client_connect section below).
///
/// The library provides an ability to discard information about currently being
/// tracked gateway. It may be useful when attempt to connect or send any messages
/// fails with timeout, which may indicate that gateway has gone offline. When
/// the gateway appears online again and advertises its presence, the gateway
/// status report callback will be invoked again reporting new availability.
/// @code
/// mqttsn_client_discard_gw(client, gwId);
/// @endcode
///
/// The library also provides an ability to discard information about all 
/// gateways at once.
/// @code
/// mqttsn_client_discard_all_gw(client);
/// @endcode
///
/// @section mqttsn_client_connect Connect / Disconnect
/// In order to establish connection to MQTT-SN gateway, the client must send
/// to it special @b CONNECT message. It must be done prior to issuing any
/// publish or subscribe request. The connection can be performed using
/// mqttsn_client_connect() call.
/// @code
/// const char* clientId = "my_client_id";
/// void my_connect_complete(void* userData, MqttsnAsyncOpStatus status)
/// {
///     if (status == MqttsnAsyncOpStatus_Successful) {
///         ... /* Connection is successful, do something */
///     }
///     else {
///         ... /* process error statuses */
///     }
///     ...
/// }

/// {
///     MqttsnErrorCode result = mqttsn_client_connect(client, clientId, 60, true, NULL, &my_client_connect, someUserData);
///     ... 
/// }
/// @endcode
/// @b NOTE, that client ID (second parameter) can be NULL or empty string. In
/// this case, the @b CONNECT message is sent to the gateway with empty client ID
/// information. The gateway will either replace it with some other default ID (based
/// on its configuration), or forward the connection request to broker with
/// empty client ID to make it an anonymous client.
///
/// Also @b NOTE, that @b will information (fifth parameter) may also be NULL to
/// indicate that will doesn't exist. NULL or empty string as topic in the
/// passed @ref MqttsnWillInfo structure will have the same effect.
/// @code
/// const char* willTopic = "this/is/will/topic"
/// const unsigned char willMsg[] = {...}
